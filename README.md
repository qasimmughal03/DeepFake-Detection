Deepfake Detection System employs a comprehensive approach combining frame extraction, feature extraction, and classification to effectively identify manipulated media. This system utilizes a combination of OpenCV for frame extraction, FaceNet for generating high-quality facial embeddings, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classification, implemented using the TensorFlow framework. Below is a detailed description of the methodology employed in the system:
•	Input Data for the Algorithm: The input data consists of video files potentially containing deepfake content. These videos are processed to extract individual frames, which serve as the basis for subsequent analysis.
•	Frame Extraction using OpenCV:  Using OpenCV, a powerful image and video processing library, each video is broken down into its constituent frames. This step is crucial as it isolates each moment of the video for individual inspection, ensuring comprehensive analysis across the entire video sequence.
•	Feature Extraction using FaceNet:Once frames are extracted, they are input into FaceNet, a deep convolutional neural network renowned for its ability to generate fixed-size feature vectors from face images. These vectors, known as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) in audio processing, capture critical facial characteristics essential for distinguishing real faces from artificially generated ones. In this system, the embeddings produced by FaceNet serve a similar purpose by encapsulating key aspects of each face in the video frames.
•	Specific Output: The specific output of the algorithm is the classification of each video as either containing deepfake content or not. This binary classification is performed by analyzing the sequence of extracted feature vectors to detect anomalies indicative of manipulation.
•	Relevant Factors for Predicting Output:
•	Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs): The extracted feature vectors are processed using an LSTM network, which is particularly adept at handling sequences and temporal data. The LSTM analyzes the embeddings over time to identify inconsistencies or patterns that are characteristic of deepfake videos.
•	Model Architecture and Training: The LSTM network is implemented within the TensorFlow framework, featuring multiple layers including dense layers with ReLU activation functions, and a softmax output layer for binary classification. The architecture and training regimen of the LSTM are critical for its ability to accurately detect deepfakes.
•	Regularization Techniques: During training, various regularization techniques are applied, such as dropout and hyperparameter tuning. These techniques are essential for preventing overfitting and ensuring that the model generalizes well to new, unseen videos.
