**Deepfake Detection System**

**Overview**
The Deepfake Detection System is designed to effectively identify manipulated media using a combination of cutting-edge technologies. It integrates OpenCV, FaceNet, and LSTM networks within the TensorFlow framework to offer a robust solution for deepfake detection.

**Methodology**

**Frame Extraction:** Utilizing OpenCV, the system breaks down video files into individual frames, enabling detailed analysis of each video moment.
**Feature Extraction:** Frames are processed through FaceNet to produce high-quality facial embeddings. These embeddings highlight critical facial features necessary to differentiate between genuine and manipulated faces.
**Classification:** An LSTM network analyzes the sequence of facial embeddings to detect patterns indicative of deepfakes. This step classifies each video as either containing manipulated content or not.


**System Architecture**

LSTM Network: Built on TensorFlow, the LSTM network features multiple layers, including dense layers with ReLU activation functions and a softmax output layer for binary classification.
Regularization Techniques: To enhance model performance and prevent overfitting, techniques such as dropout and hyperparameter tuning are employed during the training phase.
